	<p style="border: 2px dotted sienna;">A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.</p>
	<p style="border: 2px dashed darkkhaki;">Simply put, a paragraph should be as long or as short as necessary to develop a main idea. There is no absolute rule for how many sentences a paragraph must have. A paragraph can have two to three sentences, but the typical maximum number is five sentences to be considered a good paragraph.</p>
